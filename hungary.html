        <p>
          Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is a stunning city known for its
          rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultural scene.
          Divided by the Danube River into Buda and Pest, it seamlessly blends
          old-world charm with modern amenities, offering a unique experience
          for every traveler. Budapest is also a cultural hub, featuring a
          diverse range of experiences. From historic thermal baths to grand
          palaces, and from lively ruin bars to classical music concerts, the
          city caters to all tastes. Traditional events, such as the Budapest
          Spring Festival, showcase Hungary's rich heritage while contemporary
          art thrives in districts like the Jewish Quarter.

          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <p>
            Getting around Budapest is convenient, thanks to its well-developed
            public transportation system. The city boasts an extensive network
            that includes metro, trams, buses, and trolleybuses. The Budapest
            Metro, one of the oldest in the world, consists of four lines that
            connect major areas. The tram system, particularly Line 4 and Line
            6, is efficient for city travel. Buses and trolleybuses fill in gaps
            where rail service isn't available, making it easy to reach suburban
            areas and specific landmarks.
            <br /><br />

            For a more leisurely experience, many attractions are within walking
            distance in the city center, allowing you to explore the beautiful
            architecture and vibrant streets on foot.

            produce and authentic street food.
