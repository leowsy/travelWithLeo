        <h1>Hello, I'm Leo!</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my travel blog! Ever since I took my first trip at the age
          of 10, I’ve been captivated by the beauty and diversity of our planet.
          Traveling has taught me so much about different cultures, cuisines,
          and the incredible stories that connect us all. From wandering the
          cherry blossom streets of Japan to savoring the rich flavors of
          Hungary, every journey has added a new chapter to my life. I believe
          that travel is not just about the destinations but the experiences we
          gather along the way. Each place has its own unique charm, and I can’t
          wait to explore more of it!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My goal is to visit at least 30 countries by the time I turn 30. I’m
          currently planning trips to Austria and Germany, where I hope to
          immerse myself in their rich histories and vibrant cultures. Through
          this blog, I’ll share travel tips, personal stories, and guides that
          will help you navigate your own adventures. Join me as I explore the
          world, one destination at a time! Outside of travel, I enjoy
          photography, cooking, and reading about historic places. I believe
          that every journey starts with curiosity, and I’m excited to share
          mine with you!
